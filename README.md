# Restricted3BodyProblemIntro
I am new to Git and its techniques . However I have managed to add what I can to help.


This repository holds some introductory codes to Restricted Three Body Problem. Please read all the comments section in the MAINLyapOrb.m file before running the program


Currently this file can 
1) Generate the family of Lyapunov Orbits and stores some parameters like Energy , Monodromy Matrix etc for the family , Plot Surface, Contour and Lyapunov family for Sun and all nine planets and Planets and some of their moons

2) You can change the figure properties inside the plot functions as per convinience of view . 

3) I have provided enough documentation, if you feel clarity is not good please contact me . 

4) Lyapunov periodic orbit manifolds will be added later.

At this point I would like to thank 

Directly
--------
**Prof. Shane Ross** - His codes and book helped a lot and my primary reference is that book . I have referenced the name of the book inide the code.

(Please visit http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~sdross/ - for the vast areas of dynamical systems research


**Joshua Fitzgerald** -  Prof.Ross's student for clearing some doubts


**Ari Rubinsztejn** - His repository and website provodes immense animations in dynamical systems 

(Please Visit - https://gereshes.com/) for cool animations in dynamical systems


**Shankar Kulumani** -  His git repo for some parts of codes to undertstand manifolds and poincare sections

Indirectly
-------------
**Professor KC Howell** - For the research groups thesis and research that are placed online ,

Please Vist - https://engineering.purdue.edu/people/kathleen.howell.1/index.html- for papers and thesis

I will add periodic orbit manifolds later - As I lack clarity in continuation methods for Halo orbits . Specifically Pseudo arc length method. 

***************************************************************

I like to help and be helped 

The reason to start this repo is becz of difficulties I faced to get help and its too complicated to work alone without peer help and discussions. Irrespective of me continuing research in this field I have 
supplied this repo for the ones who like to start researchin this field/are new to MATLAB/ anybody who dont find appropriate codes with references.   

**Use _MATLAB 2017b_ or later.**

**Please feel free to contact me at "yfk2928@gmail.com" for suggestion/help/questions/anything you want.**

Thank You ,

Karthi. G. Ramachandran
